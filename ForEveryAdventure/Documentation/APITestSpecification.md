# Dependency Injection Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines how dependency injection is implemented in the ForEveryAdventure solution targeting .NET 8.

## Service Registration
Services are registered in `Program.cs` using the built-in .NET dependency injection container:

## Dependency Lifetimes

| Service classes | Scoped | Maintains consistency with repositories |
| Configuration | Singleton | Immutable after application start |
